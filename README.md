# Learning from Andrej

Implementing Andrej Kaparthy's Zero to Hero Lectures from scratch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&pp=iAQB)

Check out his github as well - https://github.com/karpathy


That's it. Nothing novel or fancy --- just learning from a goat and implementing what I see. 

Warning! I may use informal language in my code since this is purely for fun.
